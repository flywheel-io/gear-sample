# Test cases for the gear spec

This suite is intended for testing an implementation of the gear spec. Each example folder must be prefixed with `valid` or `invalid`, and contain a readme, a manifest, and possibly an invocation.

To run the suite against the reference implementation, run `validate.py` in this folder.
